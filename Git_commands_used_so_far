Initial Set Up Git:
sudo apt-get git

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"


git clone (url)  #intial pull request for git repository, will create a file in current directory of the git repository created in github


commonly used commands:

updating git and github when creating  a new file / file editing:

git add (file names) #adding new files to git    (can use -a for all instead of file name)
git commit (file names)  #commiting them to git   ( "                                   ")
git push  #pushing new commited files to github  (-u origin main) -- I don't know what that does, just specifies the branch? works fine without if you're already in the correct branch

updating git and local files with changes made on github - new files, file edits etc.

git fetch  #checks for new stuff on github but doesn't download it
git pull   #pulling any edits or new files made in github

switching between branches:

git branch -a             #lists both local and remote branches
git switch (branch)      #changes to specified branch

pulling a remote branch, making it a local branch:

git fetch                          #needed to retrieve metadata on new branch created in github
git checkout (branch_name)         #pulls new branch to local repository, can then be accessed using git switch (branch_name)
